Early steps towards a Partial Recursive Functions lab.

A Python-based environment to explore and experiment with partial 
recursive functions; naturally doubles as a (purely functional) 
programming language, but it is not intended to be used as such.

Each function in a script has associated Gödel number, internal
name (string with the Gödel number), nickname, comments, and code.
Gödel number stored with last operation used to construct it.
