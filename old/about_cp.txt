Initially cantorpairs was imported by prefscript as 

import scaff.cantorpairs as cp

Then cantorpairs was put as a submodule within src, and then
the usage within prefscript was

import cantorpairs.src.cantorpairs as cp

After setting up the __init__.py file with the convenient
imports, it was employed from prefscript as

import cantorpairs as cp

But then user programs would need to do

from prefscript import PReFScript, cp

which is kinda opaque, hence the current situation which is 
that in prefscript the import is just

import cantorpairs

plus

cp = cantorpairs

so that within prefscript.py the name cp can be used whereas 
from user programs one can write

from prefscript import PReFScript, cantorpairs as cp
