extended makes up for:
. primrec scheme
. compair scheme
. arbitrary constant functions k_1234567

ascii_output cuts in characters of 8 bits the binary value of the output and joins their chr version
(ancillary functions to translate back and forth would be useful)

main defines one of the function in the script as the one to be externally called
