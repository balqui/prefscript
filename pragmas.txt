Aug 2024:
 - add --version to argparse
 - rewrite doc.md to 
   - explain the two install possibilities
   - clarify the difference between pipx and pip
 - bump version to 1.1
 - ensure everything ready once more
 - remove the global prefscript, suppose pipx knows how to do it
 - upload to true pypi
 - remove the prefscript from tpy02 and/or tpytokr
 - enter venv, install with pip and check with which, call, and import
 - exit venv, check which, install with pipx, check which
 - enter venv again and recheck




.pragma extended: True
.pragma output: int / bool / ascii

Future:

.pragma cache: all (or what/how? must reach down to cantorpairs...)
.pragma output: intseq

. name aliasing (PENDING)

variantes...

[move future plans to issues, also the cantorpairs import]

====

extended makes up for:
. name aliasing (PENDING)
. primrec scheme
. compair scheme
. arbitrary constant functions k_1234567 (constant given as string for now)

output: ascii cuts in characters of 8 bits (or maybe 7) the binary 
value of the output and joins their chr version (ancillary functions 
to translate back and forth would be useful)

main defines one of the function in the script as the one to be externally called

cache: all caches all cantorpair computations, saves the time for the
arithmetic but may require about 10GB for fact(4) under extended: False

100 define funcname [what is it] pair: k_1 k_1

Errors, nonfatal:

- nickname redefined
- import from extended
- use primrec/compair/ascii_const out of extended
- unknown pragma value

Errors, fatal:

- unknown definition method (careful with "basic" which is like unknown but is known)
- undefined nickname employed (in check_names)
